#####User Story Title: Pick destination(s) 

<b>As a</b> truck driver <br />
<b>I want to</b> choose a final destination with eventual checkpoints inbetween<br />
<b>So that I can</b> get recommended places to rest at, which will improve my overall efficiency.

######Acceptance Criterion 1:
<b>Given</b> that the truck is standing still<br />
<b>When</b> a final destination is picked<br />
<b>Then</b> calculate the most efficient route and restingplaces for the truck driver.<br />

######Acceptance Criterion 2:
<b>Given</b> that the truck is standing still<br />
<b>When</b> a checkpoint is defined and the final destination is already defined<br />
<b>Then</b> calculate the most efficient route and restingplaces for the truck driver, with the final destination in mind.<br />
