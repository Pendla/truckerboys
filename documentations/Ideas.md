<h2>Idea 1: Planning tool</h2>

<p>Many truck drivers have problems following the time restrictions and find 
them frustrating, especially since there are several exceptions 
in the rules. Our first idea is an app that keeps track of the time 
the driver spends on the road, and then keeps track of the regulations 
for the driver. This can be integrated with the GPS service, which allows 
the app to plan suitable stops along the route to make it as efficient as 
possible. The route planner should be able to take several factors into 
account, such as the time regulations, the users preferred stops, and 
maybe even where the drivers friends or colleagues current are. 
The app will have to update the planned route in real time if for 
instance the driver gets stuck in traffic.</p>

<p>The purpose is to make the day to day work of a driver easier, if the
driver doesn't have to worry about the time regulations and 
route planning, he or she can focus more on driving safely and 
delivering on time.</p>

<h2>Idea 2: Notification center</h2>
	
<p>The second idea is a notification center connected to the drivers 
cellphone, that presents important notifications in a safe way. 
To expand the scope of the app, several types of feedback can be 
added to help the driver drive in a safer and more economic way.</p>
