Idea 1: Planning tool
	Many truck drivers have problems following the time restrictions and find 
	them frustrating, especially since there are several exceptions 
	in the rules. Our first idea is an app that keeps track of the time 
	the driver spends on the road, and then keeps track of the regulations 
	for the driver. This can be integrated with the GPS service, which allows 
	the app to plan suitable stops along the route based on time 
	regulations, the users preferred stops, and maybe even where the drivers 
	friends or colleagues current are. The app will update in real time to 
	adapt to the planning if for instance the driver gets stuck in traffic.

	The purpose is to make the day to day work of a driver easier, if the
	doesn't have to worry about the time regulations and route planning, he or
	she can focus more on the driving and the deliveries.

Idea 2: Notification center
	The second idea is a notification center connected to the drivers 
	cellphone, that presents important notifications in a safe way. 
	To expand the scope of the app, several typs of feedback can be 
	added to help the driver drive in a safer or more economic way.
